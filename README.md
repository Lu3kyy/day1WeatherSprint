Weather Sprint // 
Small project where we take 2 weeks and fully code out a working weather app designed by our classmates // 
first started coding 12/15/2025 // Last day coded : 12/19/2025//  
Peer reviewed by:Bryce Mack
Project looks great, validation is there. Fixed the error where when entering numbers it would give you a random place and weather. Overall amazing.



 // Person Peer Reviewed  - Pallavi Pattanashetti: The weather app worked for me,  The search bar also is functional. I was able to add to the favorites and delete the favorites. Great Work!
